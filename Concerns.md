1. Data Integration

**Concern:**  
AIDAP needs to pull data from many systems like the LMS, Calendar, and Registration system.  
If one of them goes down or updates slowly, the data might not match across the app.

The AIDAP needs to be able to pull data from many systems in the design like the LMS, Calendar, and Registration System. If even one fo them goes down or updates slowly, the data might not match across the app.

**Reason for Concern:**  
The system needs a way to keep information synced and still work even when one system fails.

2. Scalability

**Concern:**  
AIDAP will have a lot of users, especially during exam season or course registration.  
The system has to handle many requests at once without lagging.

**Reason for Concern:**  
If the system slows down or crashes, users wonâ€™t trust it, and it will fail its main goal.

3. Security and Privacy
   
**Concern:**  
AIDAP deals with private student info like schedules and grades.  
It must make sure that only the right person can see their data.

**Reason for Concern:**  
If the system leaks private data, it breaks university policy and student trust.

4. Personalization
   
**Concern:**  
The assistant learns from user interactions to give better answers.  
But saving too much personal data can become a privacy problem.

**Reason for Concern:**  
The design has to balance personal features with data protection rules.

5. Future Expansion
   
**Concern:**  
New features or data systems might be added later, like library or email support.  
The system should be easy to update without a full redesign.

**Reason for Concern:**  
Making the design flexible now will save a lot of work in the future.
